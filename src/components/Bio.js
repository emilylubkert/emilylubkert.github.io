      <p className="bio-text">
        I started my career with over 10 years in education as a teacher and
        school leader. I entered the world of software engineering when I needed a
        new challenge, and I fell in love. When I'm not coding, I might be
        biking, hiking, or skiing, depending on the season. Year-round, I love
        to cook (well, really, I love to eat), read, and play board games with
        my kids.
